# Pedro Zamboni, Ph.D
I am an Environmental Engineer with a strong academic background, including a Master's and Ph.D. in Water Resources and Sanitation. I worked for 5 years in the HEroS (Hydrology, Erosion and Sediments) Research and Laboratory Group, focused on water and soil conservation studies. I gained extensive experience in fieldwork, rainfall simulation for soil loss and infiltration studies, assessment of water and soil conservation systems, and hydro-sedimentological monitoring.

During my Ph.D., I applied Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques to address complex environmental problems, combining technological innovation with sustainable environmental management. I bring a skill set that integrates research, advanced data analysis, and field practices, contributing to developing effective, evidence-based solutions for environmental challenges.

Highly motivated and committed to achieving my professional and academic goals. Leadership, curiosity, and demonstrating strong communicative skills are key values of mine. Ease of working both individually and in groups. Passionate about innovation, artificial intelligence, environment and motivated towards continuous learning.
